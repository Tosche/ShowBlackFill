# ShowBlackFill.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert.
It fills open paths with an almost black color even while you are still drawing (yes, not perfectly black).
After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Black Fill*.
You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences. I personally set it to Option+Command+B (I could make it as default, but donâ€™t want to force it).
There is a similar plugin called [Show Filled Preview](https://github.com/mekkablue/ShowFilledPreview), and my version focuses more on neat fill without outlines, admittedly causing other info (guidelines and anchors) to be much less visible.
Huge thanks to [mekkablue](https://github.com/mekkablue) for debugging.
